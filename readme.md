This is the begining of the Google Project.
I'll try not to be too much of a perfectionist
We'll see how that pans out

Panned out! Took longer than I thought but really pleased to have finished it. Although it's not perfect. Gave up on the tooltip and micro. I'd had the micro well placed but couldn't get the tooltip working as it should do. Problem with the way that I'd managed to place the micro being the cause. Also the blend on the sign in is missing but maybe I'll come back and rectify that later. At the moment I feel like a change so will continue studying.
